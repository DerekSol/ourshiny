    "\n",
    "- When you fetch data with JavaScript, you first need to tell it where to get the data from. This is called the URL.\n",
    "- Once you know the URL, you can use JavaScript to go and get the data from that URL.\n",
    "- When the data comes back, it's usually in a format like text or JSON. This means that you might need to do some additional work to turn the data into something that your website or application can use.\n",
    "- Once you have the data, you can use JavaScript to display it on your website or application. You can put it in a table, show it on a map, or do anything else you can think of.\n",

    "### About Fetching\n",
    "#### Method\n",
    "The fetching methods are in line with the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and list as follows:\n",
    "- \"GET\": Probably the most common method you would use, which is in line with \"read\". It essentially \"gets\" the information from the API and brings it to the frontend where you are able to display it and read it.\n",
    "- \"POST\": Lines up with \"create\" and adds a resource to the API. You will probably mostly be using this with your own API or if a website adds your input to an API.\n",
    "- \"PUT\" and \"PATCH\": Essentially the \"update\" for API. Use \"PUT\" if you want to change the whole resource, or \"PATCH\" if you want to change just one part of a resource.\n",
    "- \"DELETE\": Exactly how it sounds, deletes a resource from the API\n",
